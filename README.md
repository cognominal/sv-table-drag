# svelte app

Experiment derived from a repo created with ``npx degit sveltejs/template svelte-app``
from https://github.com/sveltejs/template. it is hosted at https://drag-experiment.now.sh/

 Trying to support both mouse and touch events for eventually dragging
a separator to resize borders. Also dabbling with css.
